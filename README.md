# 🐍 Python Projects 

Welcome to my collection of Python projects — built through hands-on practice, real-world problem-solving, and experimentation in **Google Colab** and **Jupyter Notebooks**. These projects reflect my skills in data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, and automation using Python.

## 📊 Retail Analytics with Python – *Global Superstore Dataset*

**Description:**  
This project used Python to dive into global retail data and uncover insights in shipping, profit margins, and sales distribution across regions and product lines.

**📌 Features & Insights:**  
- 📉 *Shipping Cost Trends*: Time-series analysis to highlight major cost drop in 2016  
- 💰 *Profit Breakdown*: Sub-category margin analysis using Seaborn scatter plots  
- 🌍 *Regional Sales Analysis*: Pivot tables to compare Y-o-Y performance by region  
- 🧾 *Customer Order Patterns*: Count plots for order priority insights  
- 📊 *KPI Reporting*: Automated calculation of total profit, revenue, and shipping costs

**🛠 Development Workflow:**  
- `pandas.read_excel()` for data loading  
- `dropna()`, `fillna()`, and type conversion for cleaning  
- `groupby()` & `pivot_table()` for EDA  
- Charts with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Markdown documentation and reusable functions throughout the Colab notebook

## 🚀 Python Fundamentals Showcase

A fun and educational series of beginner projects to build core logic skills in Python.

### 🔧 Key Mini-Projects

- 🟡 **Shortcut Operators**  
  Efficient variable updates with `+=`, `*=`, etc.

- 🟢 **Conditional Checker**  
  ```python
  n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
  if n < 100:
      print("Less than 100")
  else:
      print("100 or more")


- 🔐 Login Simulation
Simple password verification using if/else logic
- 🎮 Guess the Secret Number Game
Combines random, loops, and user interaction
- 🧮 Odd/Even Finder
Using modulo and loops to determine number type

- 🔁 **Looping Experiment**

  for i in range(0, 11):
  if i % 2 != 0:
  print(i)


  💡 What I Learned
- Writing interactive user-input programs
- Structuring logic with loops & conditions
- Debugging and iterative problem solving
- Building confidence while making fun, useful tools
